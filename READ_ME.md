# FPGA-sythesizer

Authors:

- Thomas Jackson
- Elijsha Baetiong

This project is submitted as a final project for our CE-412 class.

# Goal
- To create a digital sythensizer that is able to play a multitude of sounds using verilog
- The sythensizer should be able to generate the following waveforms
  - Square wave
  - Triangle wave
  - SawTooth wave
  - Revesrse SawTooth waveform
  
# Current Status
We are currently wokring on the following:
- Sound generation
- play and pause feature
- external hardware builds
- schematic design (?)
